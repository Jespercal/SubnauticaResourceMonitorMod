# Subnautica Resource Monitor Game Modification
A mod for the game Subnautica. Adds two new interior modules to the game that when placed will keep track of all items held in storage containers within the base.

#### New Items:
Two new items:
* Resource Monitor Screen Large - A large screen that takes up the majority of the wall. Requires more resources to build.
* Resource Monitor Screen Small - A small screen that takes up alot less space on the wall.

#### TO:DO:
* Add more distinction between the large and small monitors:
    * The small one could display less items?
* Allow monitors to save what page they are on and on load, if possible, return back to that page.
* Allow users to pick up a item by looking at it on the screen. This should take it from a locker that contains that item.
* Add an options system with saving/loading to toggle the picking up feature.
* New screen model would be good.
* Nicer looking ui

#### Libraries
* QModManager
* SMLHelper v2
* Harmony

Thank you to https://github.com/RandyKnapp. The code used to create a canvas in 3D world space on top of the model is his.
