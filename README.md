# Subnautica Resource Monitor Game Modification
A mod for the game Subnautica. Adds two new interior modules to the game that when placed will keep track of all items held in storage containers within the base.

#### New Items:
Two new items:
* Resource Monitor Screen Large - A large screen that takes up the majority of the wall. Requires more resources to build.
* Resource Monitor Screen Small - A small screen that takes up alot less space on the wall.

#### Libraries
* QModManager
* SMLHelper v2
* Harmony

Thank you to https://github.com/RandyKnapp. The code used to create a canvas in 3D world space on top of the model is his.
